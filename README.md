IRCTC Ticket Booking System


This project is a web-based IRCTC-inspired ticket booking system built using Flask, MySQL, and DBMS. It allows users to log in, book tickets, cancel bookings, and check ticket status. The system leverages SQL triggers and stored procedures to ensure secure and efficient transaction handling. Flask is used for the backend, while MySQL manages the database operations. The project focuses on reliability, security, and ease of use.
